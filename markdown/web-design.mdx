Good web design isn't about trends or flashy effects. It's about making it easy for people to find what they need, trust what they're reading, and take the action you want them to take — whether that's donating, signing up, or getting in touch.

## What I focus on

**Clarity over clutter** Charity websites often try to do too much. I'll help you focus on what matters and structure the site so visitors aren't overwhelmed.

**Accessibility as standard** Your site should work for everyone, including people using screen readers or slow connections. This is how I build everything.

**Design that reflects your work** You're doing meaningful work. Your site should show that—neither corporate nor cheap, but polished and true to you.

**Content that's easy to manage** I'll make sure your team can update the site without calling me every time.

## How I work

Every project starts with a conversation about what you're actually trying to achieve — not just "we need a new website" but why, and for whom, and what success looks like.

From there, I'll typically work through:

- **Discovery**: understanding your organisation, your audience, and what's not working now
- **Structure**: mapping out the site's architecture before anyone opens a design tool
- **Design**: look and feel, tested against real content, not placeholder lorem ipsum
- **Build**: clean, accessible code that loads fast and works everywhere
- **Handover**: training your team so you're not dependent on me for every small change

The pace depends on your needs. A flexible approach means you get the support you need, whether that's moving quickly or taking time for feedback. We'll collaborate in a way that fits your team's workflow.
