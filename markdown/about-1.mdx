## Welcome to Big Pixel

Hello! I'm Adrian Beston, the founder of Big Pixel, where innovation and design converge. My journey in the design world has been diverse and enriching, beginning with creating engaging point-of-sale displays for recognised retailers such as Currys and PC World. This initial experience ignited my passion for user-centric design, which later guided my work on digital solutions for the short-lived Black stores.

In addition to crafting distinct brand identities for both businesses and charities, I initiated the Milton Keynes Design Forum. This cherished platform united creative minds to foster collaboration and inspire new ideas within our local community. It also allowed me to work with the UK Design Council and other design forums and have an awkward encounter with Vivienne Westwood.

Today, I specialise in web development, dedicating my expertise to technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. I focus on delivering fast, reliable, visually stunning websites that stand out in a crowded digital landscape. While I have experience with platforms like WordPress and Webflow, my passion is creating dynamic Next.js websites (like this one). This robust framework allows me to build high-performance, server-side rendered applications that engage users and improve the overall site experience.

To support these sites, I integrate dependable back-end solutions such as PostgreSQL, Fauna, and Sanity, ensuring that the websites I build are visually appealing but also robust and scalable. I aim to craft digital experiences that evolve alongside your business, adapting to new challenges while maintaining top-tier functionality.

At Big Pixel, I prioritise listening to your unique vision and translating it into a compelling digital presence that captures your audience. Let's collaborate to turn your ideas into reality and pave the way for your success in both the digital and print realms.
