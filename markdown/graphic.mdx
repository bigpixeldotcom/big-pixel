These days, most of my graphic design work comes from clients I'm already working with on web or brand projects. But it's not an afterthought or something I outsource. It's where I started, and I still love it.

## What I can help with

- Annual reports and impact reports
- Brochures and leaflets
- Event materials such as programmes, posters, banners
- Publications and newsletters
- Fundraising materials
- Business cards and stationery
- Social media assets

Basically, if it needs to be designed and either printed or exported as a PDF, I can probably help.

## Why it matters who does this

Anyone can put text in a box. The difference is whether they understand why certain things work.

I know that 6pt is the smallest text you can realistically print — and that 16pt is the minimum for Articles for the Blind. I know what widows and orphans are and why they matter. I know the difference between designing for digital print and four-colour process. I understand bleed, crop marks, gutters, and why "above the fold" still means something even when there's no actual fold.

This stuff sounds like nerdy detail, but it's the difference between something you're proud to hand out and something you hope no one looks at too closely.

## How I work

Same as everything else — a conversation first, then focused options rather than a dozen half-baked ideas that you need to sift through.

For print work, I'll also handle the print-ready files and can liaise with printers if you need me to. You won't get a PDF that the printer sends back because the bleed's wrong or the images are too low-res.
