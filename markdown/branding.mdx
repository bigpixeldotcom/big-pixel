Good branding isn't about following trends or looking "modern." It's about finding something true to your organisation and applying it consistently — so whether someone sees your website, your annual report, or your banner at an event, it all feels like the same people.

## What you get

### Logo design
Your logo in every format you'll need — web, print, social media, mono versions for when colour isn't an option. Files you can actually use, not just a single JPEG.

### Colour palette
A considered set of colours that work together and work everywhere. I use Pantone® as the basis for all colour choices, which means what you see on screen will be as close as possible to what you get in print (no nasty surprises when the brochures arrive).

### Typography
Fonts that reflect your personality and work across all your materials. I'll consider licensing, web performance, and accessibility — not just what looks nice in a pitch deck.

### Brand guidelines
A clear, practical document that shows your team (and anyone else you work with) how to use everything consistently. Not a 60-page PDF no one reads but something actually useful.

### Applications
How the brand looks in the real world: letterheads, email signatures, social templates, event materials. Enough to get you started without overwhelming you.

## How I work

I don't present ten options and ask you to pick. That just moves the hard thinking onto you.

Instead, I start with a conversation with you and your team to help me understand your organisation, who you're trying to reach, and what you want people to feel. From there, I'll come back with two directions at most. Focused options, properly thought through, not a scattergun of half-formed ideas.

Once we've agreed on a direction, I go away and build out the full system — colourways, typography, logo variations, the lot. You get something complete and ready to use, not a logo floating in a vacuum.
