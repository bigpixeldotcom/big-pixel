Good branding isn't about following trends or looking "modern." It's about finding something true to your organisation and applying it consistently — so whether someone sees your website, your annual report, or your banner at an event, it all feels like the same people.

## How I work

I don't present ten options and ask you to pick. That just moves the hard thinking onto you.

Instead, I start with a conversation with you and your team to help me understand your organisation, who you're trying to reach, and what you want people to feel. From there, I'll come back with two directions at most. Focused options, properly thought through, not a scattergun of half-formed ideas.

Once we've agreed on a direction, I go away and build out the full system — colourways, typography, logo variations, the lot. You get something complete and ready to use, not a logo floating in a vacuum.
