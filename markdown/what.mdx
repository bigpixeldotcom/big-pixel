## How I work

I'm not interested in disappearing for three months and reappearing with a finished website. I prefer ongoing relationships with regular check-ins — the kind where you actually know what's happening and I actually understand your organisation.

For larger projects, I set up a shared project board so you can see progress in real time without waiting for status updates. For ongoing retainers, we'll have regular catch-ups to review what's working and what needs attention next.

The first step is usually a conversation. No pitch decks, no pressure — just a chat to see whether we're a good fit.
